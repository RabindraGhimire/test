We evaluated the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of six large language models across three different persona types:

Instructor / Expert Demonstration (persona 0)

Narrative / Roleplay Explanation (persona 1)

Formal / Institutional Explanation (persona 2)

Findings

Across most models, personas 0 and 1 consistently produced higher ASRs than persona 2, indicating that instructive or narrative personas tend to encourage more unsafe completions.

Falcon-11B: Persona 0 and 1 had ASRs of 0.921, slightly higher than persona 2 (0.885).

Falcon-7B: Persona 1 showed the highest ASR (0.906), followed by persona 0 (0.875) and persona 2 (0.825).

Mistral-7B: Persona 1 again led (0.871), with persona 0 at 0.831 and persona 2 at 0.752.

LLaMA2-7B: Persona 1 (0.400) produced the highest ASR, while persona 0 (0.085) and persona 2 (0.377) were lower.

LLaMA2-13B: ASRs were very low across all personas (0.006, 0.075, 0.042), showing minimal vulnerability.

Phi-3: Persona 1 had the highest ASR (0.269), with persona 0 (0.158) and persona 2 (0.265) slightly lower.

Summary

Instructional and narrative personas (0 and 1) generally increase model susceptibility to unsafe completions compared to the formal persona (2).

Some models, such as LLaMA2-7B, exhibit strong sensitivity to persona, while models like LLaMA2-13B remain safe across all personas.
